#### Notes
This past Sunday 7/22/2018 was our previous designated test day. The boat was ready, as was the drone. I also contacted Alex Fogg
and he was planning to go with us as well. Saturday night 7/21/2018, Alex Fogg and I discussed whether the weather was going to make
a test possible. Ultimately the seas were forecasted to be 4-5ft and Alex Fogg and I agreed that the seas were too rough and would make
a test impossible. We are ready to test at this moment. The next possible test dates are Wednesday 8/1/2018, Saturday 8/4/2018, and 
Sunday 8/5/2018. These are the dates my dad is able to take us out on the boat to test.
