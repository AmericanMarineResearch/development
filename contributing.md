### Note on Markdown
A quick guide on writing documents with Markdown can be found here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

### Creating an update
Updates should be created on a regular basis, targeting a daily cadence. Updates will be written as markdown documents and placed in the `updates` folder of this repository. The latest template for creating updates can be found at `updates/TEMPLATE.md`. Steps are as follows: 

1. At the start of the shift, create a file (using the `Create New File` button) in the folder here: https://github.com/AmericanMarineResearch/development/tree/master/updates. Title the file YYYY-MM-DD.md

2. Plan the day, describing the day's goals.

3. Throughout the day and/or at the end of the day, update the file with progress, and plan the next steps.
