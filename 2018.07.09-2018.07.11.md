#### Goals
- [x] **Goal 1**: Finish debugging electronics unit.
- [x] **Goal 2**: Improve video feed (via tether) quality and latency.
- [x] **Goal 3**: Design tether management system.
- [ ] **Goal 4**: Asemble tether management system.
- [x] **Goal 5**: Redesign the electronics tray end pieces to allow for better camera movement, new terminal block orientation, and greater strength.
- [x] **Goal 6**: Design cradle to support the drone during transit to the test site. Boat is too harsh of a ride when operating in the gulf to use the current stand for transport.
- [ ] **Goal 7**: Fabricate the designed cradle.
- [x] **Goal 8**: Install the additional battery container penetrators.
- [x] **Goal 9**: Print new electronics tray end pieces.

#### Outcomes
- **Outcome against goal 1**: Had some issues with getting the electronics unit to communicate with QGC, fixed. Raspberry Pi was having trouble accessing firmware on sd card. Possible corrupted files on sd card. Problem seemed to have resolved itself.
- **Outcome against goal 2**: Video feed is now running at 1080p with approximately 40-50 fps. Vastly improved from previous video performance.
- **Outcome against goal 3**: Tether management system consists of a Jack Reel and a Slip Ring. All parts have arrived and are in the office.
- **Outcome against goal 4**: Tether management system will be assembled tomorrow 7/12/2018.
- **Outcome against goal 5**: Electronics tray end pieces have been redesigned to allow for the new electronics board orientation as well as the improved camera gimble range.
- **Outcome against goal 6**: Cradle is designed and will be verified tomorrow 7/12/2018. Materials will be purchased tomorrow 7/12/2018.
- **Outcome against goal 7**: Fabrication is pending material procurement.
- **Outcome against goal 8**: The additional battery conatainers and penetrators are installed and ready.
- **Outcome against goal 9**: Electronics tray end pieces are printing now. Will be done tomorrow 7/12/2018.

#### Next Steps
- Assemble tether management system.
- Attach new electronics tray end pieces.
- Attach new electronics tray to the drone.
- Test the drones functionality in its ready state.
- Attach shovel nozzle.
